Steps to publish from Visual Studio.

1. To create DACPAC file you need to publish scripts from Visual studio to Local database i.e. spilon04.
Right Click on the PrimeActs.Database project and choose Publish.
Choose the connection as spilon04 as PrimeACts DEV SQL login.
Ensure the destination name is PrimeActsDev.
This publish process will update the schema on PrimeActsDev.
You have now updated the PrimeActsDEV database on the Spilon04.

2. This database now needs to be imported to the Azure database.
To do this, you need to create a BACPAC File.
open 6_ExportBacpacfromlocaDatabase.bat 
Edit to ensure that the source database is PrimeActsDev.
Save the file. 
Open in explorer and double click to run.

3. The bacpac has now been created.
Now you need to ensure that there is a new database on Azure to import the bacpac into.
To do this run the create database script in step 7 - this will ensure the correct collation is used.

4. Import the bacpac into newly created Azure database.
Again edit the file to point to the new database, and the bacpac name.
Save file and open in file explorer and double click to run.
This will take up to half an hour to run.

Deployment of PrimeActsDev database on spilon04 to Azure completed.
